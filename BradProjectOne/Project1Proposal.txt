What I want to do:

-Start with a menu like this(Data validation to only enter number selection)
	-1 New user?
	-2 Returning user?
	-3 Exit
Handling user option selected
	-1 prompt for name and generate a userId(possibly using GUID method?) - continue to next menu
	-2 prompt for name to search DB(or userId depending on simplicity for user--GUID is way too long for them to enter) - continue to next menu
	-3 ends app

-Next Menu-- immediately if returning user(2) or after userName and userId(system generated) are established for new user(1)--(Data validation to only enter number selection)
	-1 Enter new reading
	-2 View all previous entries
	-3 Delete a previous entry
	-4 Exit
-different category collections for Systolic(top number), Diastolic(bottom number), Pulse and date of reading(could also do system date if we don't want user to manually enter a date?--undecided)
	-validation of data types
	-1 Collect/prompt user for entry of reading (will store to DB)--questions one by one
		-Once entered return to 'Next Menu'
	-2 will display all prior stored entries including the date and numbers(pulled from DB) in single view on separate lines
		-return to Next Menu - by hitting enter maybe?
	-3 will give the option to delete an entry (consider modifying if that isn't getting too complex)
		-likely need some sort of unique readingId to allow for deletion
	-4 will end app



Models(what we are trying to work with and store)--create a separate folder to store all models .CS files by topic--Ie. User, Readings, etc.  -- NEED SOME HELP HERE
	-User
		-userId (int)
		-userName (string)
		-readingId (string?) --talked about defined GUID methods if I remember right
	-Menu?
	-Reading Details -- Not sure if there should be separate individual classes for top, bottom numbers and pulse or just one?
	-Date checked(not sure if needed or could just be included in class for reading details?)



Also separate folders for presentation layer(menus in this case), data access layer(storing of data in the database) and business logic(any specific business rules needed)



Nice to haves later

-another option from menu to display average readings, and also high and low readings (with date)
